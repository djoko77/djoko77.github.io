            <h2>About Me</h2>
           <p>In my spare time, I like to read manga and watch anime. It may look a childish hobby to some people,
       but for me, apart from being entertained, I learn a lot of powerful and important life lessons. Aside from that hobby, 
       I also enjoy doing outdoor activities like playing tennis and mountaineering. With food preference,
       I love Asian cuisine, but I crave for Mexican food as well :)</p>
      
     <p>Right now, I am taking Computer Information Technology (CIT) as my major in BYU-Idaho. 
        Along this college journey, I want to learn about programming and web designing languages.
        I think by choosing this major it will be a great opportunity for me to learn these new things.
        Aside from that, I always have a passion for technology in general, so my future career by taking this major is bright.</p>
      
      <p>What I love about BYU-Idaho is the unique learning model.
        It's completely different from any other learning institution I have been with.
        It truly maximizes the learning experience of a student to the fullest;
        thus, making the student a pro active learner.</p>
      
      <p>My favorite scripture verse is Moroni 7:13, "But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually;
        wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God,
        and to serve him, is inspired of God." This verse has been in my missionary plaque to help
        me be reminded to keep doing good things. We may not experience a strong feeling of urgency to act or see a glorious light descending from
        above to signal us that it should be our next move. As long as the action is about serving Heavenly Father, then do it!</p>
